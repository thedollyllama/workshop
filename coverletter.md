## Cover Letter

Dear MIYA board of directors,

Palestine and its surrounding subsidiaries have been in the grip of a life threatening water crisis for the last 50 years with little international aid. In recent years the crisis has progressed to the point that on average people in Palestine only have access to .5L/c/d of clean usable water per day. The lack of international intervention means that there is little knowledge on how best to stem this crisis, however by observing efficiency measures and water intakes I am hoping to determine the factors that contribute the most to furthering this crisis. I propose a research based solution that will independently measure water efficiencies across municipalities in Palestine and Israel in order to create a comparative analysis of water loss between the two states. With this data we will be able to make rapid and effective steps in order to bring water to region that is dying without it. Please consider my proposal outlined below.

Sincerely,

Jonathan R. Erskine

## Problem Statement and Background

​	Although access to clean and sustainable water resources remains absent from the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, water continues to be a central, life giving, resource. Without water, it becomes impossible to achieve any of the other goals. While people can survive months with little to no food, from a biological perspective, humans perish within 3 days without access to water. After 2 days, humans have trouble moving any significant distance without fainting. This deep biological reliance on water is present in every organism on earth, and humans are no different(Maldarelli, 2019). This makes water of paramount importance when discussing development and sustainability. Nations that lack water or easy access to water have higher infant mortality rates, a common measure of a country's development, as well as remain vulnerable from economic and security perspectives(Ezeh et. al, 2014). This is of particular importance in arid regions which lack reliable sources of water, particularly The Middle East - with particular focus on Israel and Palestine. As both states vie for the same water resources, shortages are common. These shortages increase political tensions between the two states, furthering the security risks in the region as both states have remained in a volatile stalemate for many years. On top of this, the governmental and political situations in Israel and The Middle East provide the perfect fuel for water based conflict. This volatility and lack of resource security can be mapped through a variety of methods, from "Data Envelopment Analysis" (DEA) which utilizes efficiency focused data to draw conclusions, to geographical mapping data which allows researchers to view the region from a wholesale perspective. 

**Water Shortages in Palestine**

​	Water scarcity in Palestine leaves Palestinians with only half the minimum water needed per day. According to the WHO the average water availability to someone in Palestine is .5l/c/d which is half of the minimum amount needed. This is a serious problem as those living in Palestine are unable to focus on meeting other needs crucial to development if they can’t get enough water each day(Lazarova et. al, 2001). Water, being the most basic of resources, is required for both domestic and economic growth - without enough water the odds of timely and successful development in the region are significantly reduced. Especially given the arid environment in which Palestine and Israel are located, water becomes an even more vital resource and has led people to take up arms in order to obtain it. This water scarcity stems from, both, Israeli land acquisition, as well as seawater seepage into crucial aquifers that the whole Israel/Palestine region relies on(Wolf, 1996). 

​	Israel/Palestine are directly on top of several key aquifers, however, seawater seepage has rendered some of these useless and contributes to the water scarcity problem in the region. In a study done by Gasteyer et. al several geographical references are utilized to strengthen their claim. Referencing a map of the naturally occurring aquifers in Israel/Palestine, they explain the conflict in which both the Israelis and Palestinians lay claim to the aquifers. This specifically is an issue in the West Bank, as the Coastal, Northeastern, and Tiberius Aquifers all originate there - leading the Palestinians to claim ownership of them(Gasteyer et. al, 2012) . However, due to the movement of groundwater within those aquifers towards Israel and surrounding countries, Israel lays claim to them as well - using this to justify their acquisition of land in order to siphon from them(Wolf, 1996).

​	Israel land acquisition is another key factor that draws water away from the Palestinians and into Israeli hands. The Israeli government views the Palestinian land as unproductive and takes it freely to secure resources. This argument would be backed by many Palestinians as they view the creation and maintenance of the State of Israel as a form of imperialism due to the significant historical problems between the two peoples. Language is another key method with which Israel uses to justify their land claims. This includes words and phrases such as “barren” “infertile” and painting the Palestinians as “savages” in the eyes of some Israelis(Alsharif, 2008). This land acquisition has allowed Israel to infringe on the Tiberius aquifer and siphon water from it. This seizure of water has exacerbated the already problematic water crisis and made it even more dangerous for the Palestinians. 

​	Without rapid international intervention, Palestine's water resources could be entirely gone within the next 7 years. This is a result of Israeli land acquisition as well as the seawater seepage that continues to plague the costal aquifers. Additionally, the threat of water shortages continues to rise across the globe. Meaning that without urgent and effective intervention, even more countries could fall victim to the same, or similar, fate as Palestine. Water is fundamental to human life and continued existence, without it we simply cannot develop and survive. 

## Methodology

The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) relies on measuring the performance of input to output ratios, thus works well to determine how Palestinian municipalities can increase the efficiency of their already low water resources and prevent further loss. Originally proposed by Charnes et. al in 1981, it continues to be a useful tool, with clear advantages over other tools, such as regression. While regression gives uniform values for all inputs and outputs, DEA gives some inputs and outputs more weight depending on how critical they are in the overall water supply. It can be structured around inputs or outputs. Meaning some inputs can be given more weight and some outputs can be given less depending on their strength. The most important thing that DEA can do is measure returns to scale (RTS). The RTS assigns weight to inputs and outputs depending on their overall effect on the scale of the municipality being measured - making it a versatile tool for a measure of any municipality. RTS is useful as it is part of variable returns to scale (VRS), which allows the DEA to minimize inputs and maximize outputs simultaneously and allows the DEA to measure the overall relative efficiency of each municipality measured. The VRS is measured through the BCC method, and demonstrates the returns to scale. BCC uses several variables, where xij and yrj are inputs and outputs respectively. VRS is shown here:

RTS model is shown here:

RTS is either increasing, decreasing, or constant depending on if Mu null is greater than, less than, or equal to zero. Additionally, the primal model of RTS breaks the different municipalities into two groups, either efficient (on the frontier) or inefficient (below the frontier). Y and X are the matrices of outputs and inputs respectively. S- and S+ are the shortfalls in production and consumption slacks. For this model, efficiency is achieved if all slacks are equal to zero.  Additionally, eT represents the summation vector. The combination of these equations allows the large data to be taken and crunched into small, more digestible numbers. After these two equations are utilized they results are taken and inserted into a final function called the RTS additive primal model, seen here: 

![image-20200419145535161](C:\Users\JR Erskine\Desktop\williamandmary\human dev\primalRTS)

This final equation takes the culmination of the other two equations in order to give final efficiency values. A municipality is deemed "efficient" according to DEA if the change in the consumption and production slacks are equal to or greater than zero. This makes the data easy to use and easy to insert into larger charts since the outputs all range around zero. A collection of data in obviously necessary for this to work. Specifically the water losses (in this example all losses and gains measured in the New Israeli Shekel, the currency in Palestine), water and energy spending, maintenance and other expenses, including salary of workers and total revenue. Example table can be seen here, courtesy of Alsharif et. al: ![image-20200419151106270](C:\Users\JR Erskine\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200419151106270.png)

This data, as well as the same data for 2000, 2001, and 2002, is summarized and inserted to a program with the equations pre-loaded. This large dataset allows us to look at each individual municipality as well as Palestine on the whole. The final results from this analysis can be seen here: ![image-20200419182406334](C:\Users\JR Erskine\Desktop\williamandmary\human dev\alsharifresults)

 The ability to look at each individual municipality allows us to cross reference spending and efficiency along preexisting geographic data. With this we can view how different water sources are used and with what level of efficiency, meaning that we can, both, demonstrate possible solutions for the present, as well as make predictions about when the water will run out in the future. The level of preparedness that the DEA provides is crucial for a region undergoing a water crisis, as crises such as this one often last for many years without stopping. Additionally, when the data is graphed over many years, it is possible to see clear trends in efficiency and use in order to determine if the changes implemented (if any) actually made a difference in the region. 

​	In order to further the research that has already been done, the ability to account for other, more random variables, must be included. The inclusion of a confidence interval would be a very basic way to account for any possible random errors that may have occurred and resulted in skewed data. This would make it easier to predict potential eventualities, as well as create a clearer picture of the present.
